# calculator
The first thing I did was define the different operators
Next, I gave the user a choice as to which operator he would use, by selecting a number between 1 and 4
Following the selection of an operator, the user is asked to input their first number, followed by their second number
After inputting their numbers, the two numbers are calculated based on the operator and the result is printed to the user
